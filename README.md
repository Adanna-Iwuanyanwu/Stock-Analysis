##THE ANALYSIS
My aim in doing this analysis is to see how the stocks of these tech companies have performed in the market from January 2013 to March 2023. I observed that there has been a rise in the price of the stocks in the market from 2013 till 2022 and a downtrend in the stock price in the first quarter of 2023 which shows the fluctuation of the stock prices.

Even with the price drop, Microsoft stock still maintained a good price in the stock market while Meta stock had a massive drop in the stock market. Over the years, Apple stock has had more buyers than the rest of the other stocks which could be attributed to their product sales and launch yearly. There has been a drastic reduction in-stock purchases during the first quarter of 2023, which could be linked to the global recession that has hit many countries, competition or regulatory policies guiding these big tech companies on data usage. This downtrend in stock price can be seen between the last quarter of 2022 and the first quarter of 2023.
There was a sharp downtrend in Meta stock price in the first quarter of 2023 which shows that the social media company could have more slowdown in its advertising growth. 

On the other hand, Microsoft’s stock price has been on the rise which could be attributed to the announcement they made on March 16 about adding artificial intelligence tools to its popular office productivity applications. They introduced a feature called Microsoft 365 Copilot. The Copilot feature uses next-generation AI to automate and simplify tasks and provide suggestions.
